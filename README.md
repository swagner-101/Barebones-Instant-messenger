# Barebones Instant Messenger (BIM)
This GitHub repo is for our team project for the University of Victoria's SENG 299 class (Software Architecture and Design). The goal of this project was to design a client-server chat system that could handle 1000 users with an appropriate GUI. 

## Features of BIM:

* Written in Python 3
* Server supports 1000 clients
* Fully functional client GUI (only macOS is supported)
* Users can create, join, and leave chat rooms
* Alias are specific to the current chat room
* Error Handling (Example: Client attempts to join a non-existent chat room)
* Both the server and client use python multi-threading
* Network communication handled with python sockets
* High cohesion, low coupling system architecture
